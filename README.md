# MutantCrawlers
Mutant Crawlers Infestation

This mod brings a mutated version of the existing crawlers which are larger, nastier and spits toxic acid. 

These mutated crawlers are stronger against conventional weapons but more vulnerable to heat-based weapons, explosives and melee.

Their drop is balanced in regards of the new event to provide some small amounts of raw keinite and toxines which would stack up
considerably if the player decides to join the event to kill them and collect the loot.

The new event consists of a massive infestation of mutated crawlers emerging across the roads in the whole map.
As the event will provide a new resource of keinite it is lasting only 10 minutes to avoid turning into a replacement of the
other existing sources of keinite currently available. 

The event is triggered relativelly often and is set to ignore if there are other events in order to bring some 
challenge when returning from other events or from any PvE or PvP encounters that might happen.

Additionaly, a group of mutated crawlers now spawn in the surrounding area of the meteorites aiming to add a more dynamic gameplay
for PvE players and maybe some trouble if used in PvP. 

Some critical changes were made to the Meteorite event to adapt it to the presence of the mutant crawlers:

Event radius:
          PvE from 52 tiles to 72
          PvP from 80 tiles to 100

Distance between meteorites:
          From 22 tiles to 30 tiles

Event duration:
          From 30 mins to 40 mins
          
Meteorites per area:
          PvE from 4 to 5
          PvP no changes

The event radius and distance between meteorites were enlarged to allow a better spread of the mutant crawlers around the meteorites.

The duration was also adapted in order to allow a more tactical approach to clear the area from creatures and also to provide PvE 
and solo players some extra time to recover their loot if they die in the event.

One more meteorite added for PvE to add value to the event due to its additional difficulty.

To do: Spit attack animation needed for the mutant crawlers.
